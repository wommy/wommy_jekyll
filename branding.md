## wommytilliams

my name has evolved numerous times throughout my life

in grade school, all my friends called me tommy when i got to middle school, i shortened it to tom

i later realized that all my close friends called me tommy so i switched my facebook name to tommy williams overnight, all the people i barely knew started addressing me as tommy

the newest iteration, wommytilliams came about in college, a bad breakup was causing me to be negative, people started joking that i had some type of alter ego, if tommy williams was dr jekyll, wommy tilliams was mr hyde

"wommy" was really taking off, yet it served reference to this spect of myself i didnt like, so i did the only thing i could and took it back

i bought [wommytilliams.com](//wommytilliams.com)

wommy tilliams uniqueness is a double-edged sword: visually, wommy tilliams is relatively easy to get, auditorily, it sounds like a jarbled nothing

brand wise, it you know tommy williams, wommy tilliams isnt too hard to get

if your first move explain your brand
