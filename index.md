## inspiration / philosophy

### words

- simple
- concise
- clean
- eloquent
- minimal
- transparent

### websites

- [//facsrc.cdm.depaul.edu/~cmiller/](//facsrc.cdm.depaul.edu/~cmiller)  
a teacher of mine, one of the first websites i encountered that put [function over form](https://ims21.net/web_form_function.htm)

- [//itemsandthings.com](//itemsandthings.com)  
one of my favorite music labels, their brand's dedication to minimalism is conveyed thoroughly, from their music to their web design.

- [www.wanna-rework.de](www.wanna-rework.de)  
one musicians website on the above label

### psych

my psych career is long and winging

my first introduction to psychology was through [myers-briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myersâ€“Briggs_Type_Indicator)

hours of trawling google led me to 

#### socionics

socionics was everything i was looking for

socionics' [rationality / irrationality](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Rationality_and_irrationality#Typical_characteristics) replaces mbti's judgment / perception  
mbti's judgment / perception still exists within socionics, but it is instead a second level dichotomy, [static / dynamic](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Static_and_dynamic#Typical_characteristics)


socionics going into much greater detail than myers-briggs:

- [intertype relations](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations) - descriptions of interactions between types
- [small groups](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Small_groups) - common ground between types
- [subtypes](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Subtypes) - no two types are the same
- [modal a](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Model_A)
- [second level dichotomoies](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Reinin_dichotomies)
- [information elements](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_elements)
- [functions](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Functions) which allows for [functional dichotomies](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Function_dichotomies)
	

[information metabolism](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_Metabolism) - can be simplified as follows:  
every action you do, is based on information.

#### horoscopes

[the secret language](https://www.thesecretlanguage.com/today/), my number one to-go-to

> [here](https://sln.me/app/) you can check your or anothers birthday  
( check you and a parent )  
and your relationships with other people  
( check an old or current flame )

[cafe astrology](https://astro.cafeastrology.com)

> i personally like their [natal chart](https://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal)  
and their [relationship chart](https://astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/comp2f)

#### tarot year

[heres an easy calculator i just found](https://www.tarotschool.com/Calculator.html)

> for example:  
i want to check for my current year  
since my birthday has not happened yet, i check for last year
